### Aggregated prey density across multiple watersheds

*This package is for sourcing prey density across multiple watersheds and habitat types. Also included in this package are fish mass and and fork length data as well as associated environmental (temperature and dissolved oxygen) data. All data can be used in the CVPIA salmon life cycle models.*

#### Installation

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("CVPIA-OSC/DSMprey")
```

#### Usage

This package provides habitat related datasets to the [`fallRunDSM,`](https://github.com/CVPIA-OSC/fallRunDSM) [`springRunDSM,`](https://github.com/CVPIA-OSC/springRunDSM) [`winterRunDSM,`](https://github.com/CVPIA-OSC/winterRunDSM) and [`latefallRunDSM`](https://github.com/CVPIA-OSC/latefallRunDSM) packages.

``` r
# datasets within the package
data(package = 'DSMprey')
```

#### About the Datasets

Datasets were aggregated from multiple authors and across many watersheds. For each dataset, the habitat type was assigned. Specific methods and supporting documents for data aggregation and decisions in every watershed are provided on the reference tab.

##### Prey Density Datasets

-   `all_prey_density`

-   `monthly_prey_density`

##### Fish Datasets:

-   `all_fish_data`

-   `monthly_fish_data`

##### Environmental Datasets:

-   `all_enviro_data`

#### Joining Datasets

Datasets can be joined on `site`, see example below:

```{r}
## All data: 
all_prey <- DSMprey::all_prey_density
all_fish <- DSMprey::all_fish_data
all_enviro <- DSMprey::all_enviro_data 

# all prey density and fork length/mass data
all_prey_and_fish <- all_prey %>% left_join(all_fish)

# join environmental data with prey density:
all_prey_and_enviro <- all_prey %>% left_join(all_enviro)

## Monthly Data:
monthly_prey <- DSMprey::monthly_prey_density
monthly_fish <- DSMprey::monthly_fish_data

monthly_prey_and_fish <- monthly_prey %>% left_join(monthly_fish)
```

### Dependencies

The `DSMprey` package provides data for several other packages within the [CVPIA Open Science Collaborative](https://github.com/CVPIA-OSC).
