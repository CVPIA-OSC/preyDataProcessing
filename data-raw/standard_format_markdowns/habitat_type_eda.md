## Habitat Type

### Types:

Sampling locations were assigned the following habitat types:

-   perennial instream

-   floodplain

-   agricultural canal TODO: change to perennial instream?

-   side channel TODO: change to perennial instream?

-   rice field

### Methodology

Habitat types were defined for the following datasets according to the following rulesets.

-   **Cordoleani**: locations (latitude, longitude) were provided by Cordoleani as well as habitat types. The provided habitat types were mapped to a consistent format using the rules:
    -   `Agriculture` = `agricultural canal`

    -   `Channel` = `perennial instream`

    -   `River Channel` = `perennial instream`

    -   `Wetland` = `floodplain`
-   **Corline**:
    -   The locations of the fields (Knaggs Ranch) were provided by Corline

    -   The location of the inlet canal (Toe Drain) was determined using best professional judgement and guidance from Corline et al.

    -   Location of the Sacramento River sampling site was provided in the paper Corline et al. as Sherwood Harbor

    -   The `habitat_type` was defined using best professional judgement from monitoring locations
-   **Zeug**:
    -   The San Joaquin River sampling locations (latitude, longitude) were provided by Zeug

    -   The \`habitat_type\` was defined using best professional judgement from monitoring locations

    -   No locations data was provided for sampling sites on the Merced River
-   **Montgomery**: locations (latitude, longitude) and habitat types were provided by Jacob Montgomery
-   **Guignard**: locations (latitude, longitude) were provided by Guignard. The habitat types were assigned using best professional judgement and following ruleset based off the site location names:
    -   `Main Channel` = `perennial instream`

    -   `Top Side` and `Lower Side` = `side channel` TODO: should we map this as perennial instream?

    -   `Upper Floodplain`, `Middle Floodplain`, `Lower Floodplain` = `floodplain`
-   **Zooper**: locations (latitude, longitude) were provided by the Zooper library. Habitat types were assigned based on the following ruleset:
    -   If the data was collected in Yolo Bypass, it was assigned floodplain

    -   If the data was collected in the North or South Deltas, it was assigned perennial instream
